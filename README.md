# NFL Game Prediction using nfl_data_py

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib import pyplot  
import warnings
import os
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')

What it does: Basic setup - imports data science libraries and suppresses warnings so the output isn't messy with warning messages.
LINES 20-46: MACHINE LEARNING IMPORTS
python

# Core ML libraries
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, cross_val_score, RepeatedStratifiedKFold, GridSearchCV
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.feature_selection import RFE
from sklearn.discriminant_analysis import LinearDiscriminantAnalysis as LDA
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier, VotingClassifier
from sklearn.calibration import CalibratedClassifierCV as CCV
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline

What it does: Imports all the machine learning tools:

    train_test_split: Splits data into training and testing sets

    StandardScaler: Normalizes data so all features are on same scale

    RFE: Recursive Feature Elimination - automatically picks best features

    Various classifiers: Different ML algorithms to try

    VotingClassifier: Combines multiple models for better predictions

LINES 48-64: OPTIONAL ADVANCED IMPORTS
python

# Advanced ML libraries
try: 
    import xgboost as xgb
    HAS_XGB = True
except ImportError:
    HAS_XGB = False
    print("XGBoost not available. Install with: pip install xgboost")

# NFL data library
try:
    import nfl_data_py as nfl
    HAS_NFL_DATA = True
except ImportError:
    HAS_NFL_DATA = False
    print("nfl_data_py not available. Install with: pip install nfl_data_py")

What it does: Tries to import advanced libraries but doesn't crash if they're missing. This makes the code more robust.
LINES 66-80: MAIN CLASS SETUP
python

class NFLGamePredictor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.models = {}
        self.best_features = []
        self.scaler = StandardScaler()
        self.final_model = None

What it does: Creates the main predictor class that will hold all the models, features, and data scalers.
LINES 82-196: DATA COLLECTION METHOD
python

def collect_data(self, start_year=2010, end_year=2024, save_csv=True, data_folder='nfl_data'):

What it does: This is the data downloader - it uses nfl_data_py to grab:

    Play-by-play data (every single play from games)

    Weekly team stats

    Game schedules

    Team information

It saves everything as CSV files so you don't have to re-download every time.
LINES 198-267: INJURY ESTIMATION METHOD
python

def _calculate_injury_percentage(self, team_data):

What it does: Since NFL injury data isn't always available, this clever method estimates injury impact by looking at:

    Passing consistency (if QB is hurt, passing stats vary more)

    Rushing consistency

    Completion percentage changes

    Fantasy points volatility

It calculates a "injury percentage" based on how inconsistent a team's performance has been.
LINES 269-316: TEAM FEATURE CREATION
python

def create_team_features(self, weekly_data, season, week):

What it does: For each team, it calculates season averages up to a given week:

    Passing yards per game

    Rushing yards per game

    Points per game

    Turnovers per game

    Injury percentage

    Games played

This gives a snapshot of how each team was performing at that point in the season.
LINES 318-377: GAME FEATURE CREATION
python

def create_game_features(self, home_team, away_team, team_features, season, week, is_playoff=False, is_neutral=False):

What it does: Creates features for a specific matchup by comparing the two teams:

    Raw stats: Each team's offensive numbers

    Advantage metrics: Home passing advantage = home passing - away passing

    Context features: Home field advantage, playoff game, etc.

    Injury comparisons: Which team is healthier

LINES 379-447: DATASET BUILDER
python

def build_dataset(self, pbp_data, weekly_data, schedule_data, save_csv=True, data_folder='nfl_data'):

What it does: This is the core data processing engine that:

    Loops through every scheduled game

    Gets team features for that point in season

    Creates matchup features

    Adds the actual game result (who won)

    Builds a complete dataset of games with features and outcomes

LINES 449-507: FEATURE SELECTION
python

def select_features(self, df, n_features=13):

What it does: Uses Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to automatically find the most important features. It tests different numbers of features and picks the combination that gives the best prediction accuracy.
LINES 509-564: MODEL TRAINING
python

def train_models(self, df):

What it does: Trains multiple ML models and compares their performance:

    Logistic Regression

    Decision Tree

    Random Forest

    XGBoost (if available)

It uses cross-validation to get reliable accuracy estimates for each model.
LINES 566-625: HYPERPARAMETER TUNING
python

def tune_best_model(self, df, model_name='Random Forest'):

What it does: Once the best model type is found, this method fine-tunes its settings using Grid Search - it systematically tests different parameter combinations to find the optimal setup.
LINES 627-654: ENSEMBLE MODEL CREATION
python

def create_ensemble_model(self, df):

What it does: Creates a voting classifier that combines predictions from multiple models. This often works better than any single model alone. It also calibrates the probabilities so the confidence scores are more accurate.
LINES 656-681: PREDICTION ENGINE
python

def predict_games(self, games_df, confidence_threshold=0.6):

What it does: The final prediction method that:

    Takes new game data

    Generates win probabilities

    Makes binary predictions (home win/loss)

    Identifies "high confidence" bets where the model is very sure

LINES 683-725: EXECUTION SCRIPT
python

# Initialize predictor
predictor = NFLGamePredictor()

What it does: This is the actual code that runs when you execute the script. It:

    Creates the predictor object

    Downloads NFL data

    Builds the dataset

    Trains all models

    Tests on 2023 season

    Shows final accuracy

HOW THE WHOLE SYSTEM WORKS:

    Data Collection → Downloads years of NFL stats

    Feature Engineering → Creates smart features from raw stats

    Model Training → Tests multiple ML algorithms

    Ensemble Creation → Combines best models

    Prediction → Makes game predictions with confidence scores
